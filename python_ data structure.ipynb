        "### Theoretical Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**\n",
        "   Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are important because they enable efficient data management and manipulation, which is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and software.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**\n",
        "   - Mutable data types can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists and dictionaries.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list[0] = 10  # This works\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Immutable data types cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include strings and tuples.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     try:\n",
        "         my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise an error\n",
        "     except TypeError as e:\n",
        "         print(e)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "   - Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**\n",
        "   Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a value. This allows for efficient data retrieval based on the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**\n",
        "   Sets are used when you need to store unique elements and perform operations like union, intersection, and difference efficiently. They do not allow duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**\n",
        "   A string is a sequence of characters, while a list is a sequence of elements that can be of any data type. Strings are immutable, whereas lists are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**\n",
        "   Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This ensures that the data remains constant and cannot be accidentally modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**\n",
        "   A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables, allowing for efficient key-based data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
        "   Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**\n",
        "    Strings are immutable to ensure data integrity and allow for efficient memory management and optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**\n",
        "    Dictionaries offer efficient key-based data retrieval, making them suitable for tasks that require fast lookups, such as implementing caches or storing configuration settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**\n",
        "    Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that all elements are unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**\n",
        "    Tuples are preferable when you need to store a fixed collection of elements that should not be modified, such as coordinates or configuration settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**\n",
        "    - For lists, the `in` keyword checks if an element is present in the list.\n",
        "    - For dictionaries, the `in` keyword checks if a key is present in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**\n",
        "    No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.**\n",
        "    A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary as a value. It is useful for representing hierarchical data.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    nested_dict = {\n",
        "        \"person\": {\n",
        "            \"name\": \"John\",\n",
        "            \"age\": 30\n",
        "        },\n",
        "        \"address\": {\n",
        "            \"city\": \"New York\",\n",
        "            \"zip\": \"10001\"\n",
        "        }\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**\n",
        "    The average time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1) due to the use of hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**\n",
        "    Lists are preferred when you need to maintain an ordered collection of elements or when you need to perform operations like slicing or iterating over elements in a specific order.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
        "    Dictionaries are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of elements based on their insertion. This means that the order of elements may not be consistent when iterating over the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
        "    - Lists use index-based retrieval, where elements are accessed by their position in the list.\n",
        "    - Dictionaries use key-based retrieval, where elements are accessed by their unique keys.\n",
        "\n",
