        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's popular because of its versatility, extensive libraries, and active community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it to machine code that the computer can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names). Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `return`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for specific syntactic purposes in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed. This distinction allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   The `==` operator checks for value equality, meaning it checks if the values of two objects are the same. The `is` operator checks for identity equality, meaning it checks if two objects refer to the same memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. The main logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another. This can be done explicitly by using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python, while explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using casting functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They help in decision-making processes within a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    The `elif` statement in Python is short for \"else if.\" It allows to check multiple conditions in a sequence. If the first condition is false, it checks the next `elif` condition, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) for a specific number of times. A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    A `while` loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being met. For example, reading user input until a valid response is received.\n",
